- Connect all the components and the air cored coil as shown in the figure.
- </br>
- Set the product of $R_2 R_3$ at a convenient value and obtain the balance by varying $R_1$ and $C_1$.
- </br>
- Decide the ranges for $R_1$ and $C_1$ through which they can varied without bringing database at noise C.R.O.
- </br>
- Repeat the procedure with different values of the product $R_2 R_3$ and decide upon readings that permit maximum accuracy for the measurement.
