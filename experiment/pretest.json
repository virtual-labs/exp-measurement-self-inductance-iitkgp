      "question": "The arm of an a.c. Maxwell inductive bridge arranged as follow, AB is a non inductive resistance of 1000Ω in parallel with a capacitor of capacitance 0.5µF, BC is a non inductive resistance of 600Ω, CD is an inductive impedance (unknown) and DA is a non inductive resistance of 400 Ω. If balance is obtain under this condition, determine the inductance and resistance of an arm CD.<br/><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"./image/quiz1.jpg\" style=\"width:460px;height:330px;\"></p>",
