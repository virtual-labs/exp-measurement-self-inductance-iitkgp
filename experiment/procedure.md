1. Connect all the components and the air cored coil as shown in the figure.
</br>
2. Set the product of R<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> at a convenient value and obtain the balance by varying R<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>
</br>
3. Decide the ranges for R<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> through which they can varied without bringing database at noise C.R.O.
 </br>
4. Repeat the procedure with different values of the product R<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> and decide upon readings that permit maximum accuracy for the measurement.
